# Industrial Automation & Electrical Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains technical projects demonstrating hands-on skills in industrial electrical systems, automation fundamentals, and fault-oriented problem solving.  
Focus areas include PLC logic, industrial wiring concepts, and system reliability.

## Background
I am an electrical engineering student completing an Associate’s Degree in Electrical Engineering with professional experience in industrial fabrication and manufacturing environments. My background includes interpreting engineering schematics, working to safety and quality standards, and maintaining equipment reliability.

## Project Focus
- PLC ladder logic (Siemens platform)
- Industrial control concepts
- Electrical schematics and panel layouts
- Instrumentation and sensor integration
- Troubleshooting and fault analysis

## Projects
### PLC Motor Control with Safety Interlocks
- Start/Stop control with seal-in logic
- Emergency stop override
- Fault detection and reset logic
- Designed for deterministic operation and safe failure modes

(Additional projects will be added as development progresses.)

## Tools & Platforms
- Siemens TIA Portal
- PLC simulation environments
- AutoCAD (basic electrical layouts)
- Hand and power tools for industrial systems

## Notes
Projects are designed to reflect real-world industrial scenarios with emphasis on safety, uptime, and maintainability.
